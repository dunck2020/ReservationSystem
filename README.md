# ReservationSystem
This is the first phase of a front desk hotel application.  Hotel name and rooms are random creations, room availability is determined by room only.  Using dates
and most likely a large data base is out of my scope at this time.  The app is desiged to allow a user to create a reservation, check in guests using the 
reservation information.  Check out guests from a file of current guests.
